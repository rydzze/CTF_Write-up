# 🏴‍☠️ CTF Write-up

> _Welcome to my **Capture The Flag (CTF) writeup** repository!_

<br/>

This repository is a collection of solutions, notes, and exploit scripts from various CTF challenges, with a primary focus on:

- 👨🏻‍💻 **Reverse Engineering** — dissecting binaries, analysing assembly, defeating protections
- 👾 **Binary Exploitation** — buffer overflows, ROP, format string attacks, heap pwn, and more

<br/>

Whether you're here to learn, explore, or pwn, this repository documents my journey into **low-level hacking**, using tools like **Ghidra**, **GDB**, **pwntools**, and other reverse-engineering magic.
