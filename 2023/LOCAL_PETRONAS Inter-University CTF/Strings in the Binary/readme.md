## Strings in the Binary

### üìö Overview

Change the hex value in `obscured_flag.bin` to get the flag from the decoded text by using HxD (Hex Editor).

### ‚ú® Solution

Open the file and you will find that the flag is incomplete. It looks like the hex value represents the ASCII characters.

Since we know the format of the flag is `petgrad2023{xxxxx}`, here is what I came up with:
- Increase the hex value by 20 if the decoded text is an uppercase letter, symbol, or blank.
- Decrease the hex value by 20 if the decoded text is a lowercase letter.

### üè≥Ô∏è Flag

Hence, the flag is `petgrad2023{B1nary_Exp10r3r}`
