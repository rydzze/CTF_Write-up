### üìö Overview

Debug `dynamic.apk` using `Android Studio` and dive deep into the source code to find the flag.

### ü§î Hint

> _"While Java holds the clues, the real answers may lie in the realm of native libraries."_

### ‚ú® Solution

Let's start the challenge by reading `dynamic.apk` using an APK decompiler. In this case, I used `jadx-gui` in Kali Linux.

Whenever they give us an APK file, jump straight to the `MainActivity` inside /com directory.

It looks like the string flag was split into 4 parts and it will be combined together later on. Let's take a look at `LiveLiterals$MainActivityKt`.

We have obtained parts 1, 2, and 4 of the string so we have to find where is part 3 stored. 

```Java
public final String m5402String$arg0$callloadLibrary$classCompanion$classMainActivity() {
        if (LiveLiteralKt.isLiveLiteralsEnabled()) {
            State<String> state = f52x1d7c04fd;
            if (state == null) {
                state = LiveLiteralKt.liveLiteral("String$arg-0$call-loadLibrary$class-Companion$class-MainActivity", f57String$arg0$callloadLibrary$classCompanion$classMainActivity);
                f52x1d7c04fd = state;
            }
            return state.getValue();
        }
        return f57String$arg0$callloadLibrary$classCompanion$classMainActivity;
    }
```

By looking at this function inside `LiveLiterals$MainActivityKt`, I assumed that the source code loads the library to get the string value AND not to mention that the string `f57String$arg0$callloadLibrary$classCompanion$classMainActivity` was assigned with the value "nativeFlagPart". This actually hints to us that we have to access the native library of the APK file to get part 3 of the string (This one I _'palatao'_ lol).

So, we have to debug `dynamic.apk` using an APK debugger. In this case, I used `Android Studio` in Windows.

After the debugging process, I still didn't manage to open the file so I hopped on Ghidra straight away. You can find the `libdynamicflagchallenge.so` file by referring to the top ribbon in the image above (varies depending on the user).

### üè≥Ô∏è Flag

Hence, the flag is `petgrad2023{Qu@ntum_N3xu$_C0d3br3@k3r}`
