## Show Flag

### üìö Overview

Open the app to show the flag!

### ‚ú® Solution

When we run the `showflag.exe`, it will give us one out of the five images randomly.

Now, open the `showflag.exe` in [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) and look at the class `flags` (refer to the image below).

It looks like we are only calling for the `flag1`, `flag2`, `flag3`, `flag4`, `flag5` while `donotopen` and `flag6` is not called.
What we can do is edit the IL instructions of class `flags` to retrieve `donotopen` and `flag6`.

Left-click on the operand with the opcode "call", choose Method and then pick `donotopen` and `flag6`.
It is going to look like this, depending on your preferences ;).

Press OK and then `Ctrl + Shift + S` to save all the changes made to the `showflag.exe` file. Next, run it.
